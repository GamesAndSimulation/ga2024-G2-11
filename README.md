# The Naturals' Descent

This project is using the following plugins:

- **Cinemachine**: For the cameras;
- **Unity's new input system**: For defining the game's controls;
- **Fast Script Load**: Avoid long compiling times;

## Warning
The project has auto compiling disabled, so press ``` Ctrl + R ``` in the editor after changing code to compile it.

This is required by *Fast Script Load* and itÂ´s also good for avoiding annoying long compilations when going back and forth between the code and the editor.
